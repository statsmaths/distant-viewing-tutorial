<p>This repository contains materials related to the workshop that Lauren Tilton and I gave at CMU and DH2018 - Mexico City. All of the materials for the workshop are available here. The abstract for the workshop is as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This tutorial provides a hands-on introduction to the use of deep learning techniques in the study of large image corpora. The tensorflow and keras libraries within the Python programming language are used to facilitate this analysis. No prior programming experience is required.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Image analysis tasks covered in the tutorial include object detection, facial recognition, image similarity, and image clustering. We will make three open-access image corpora (historic photographs, still frames from moving images, and scanned works of art) available in order to test these methods. Alternatively, participants may bring and use an image dataset of interest to them. At the conclusion of the tutorial, participants will have created an interactive website running locally on their machines. This website will provide tools for analyzing their selected dataset. Additional instructions for making the website publicly available will be provided.</p>

<p>For a quick overview of the material covered in the workshop, you can view the executed Python notebooks directly through GitHub with no required set-up. Simply follow the links below (parts 3 and 5 are only applicable on your own machine):</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><a href="https://github.com/statsmaths/distant-viewing-tutorial/blob/master/distant-viewing-tutorial-part-1.ipynb">Part 1: Introduction and shallow features</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/statsmaths/distant-viewing-tutorial/blob/master/distant-viewing-tutorial-part-2.ipynb">Part 2: Deep learning for image processing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/statsmaths/distant-viewing-tutorial/blob/master/distant-viewing-tutorial-part-4.ipynb">Part 4: Face detection and recognition</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/statsmaths/distant-viewing-tutorial/blob/master/distant-viewing-w-deep-learning.pdf">Accompanying slides (pdf)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We do, however, recommend following along with the materials and notes on your own machine as described in the steps below.</p>
<h3 id="set-up">Set-up</h3>
<p>To start, you'll need an up-to-date version of Python 3 and several common modules. The easiest way to do this is to download and install Anaconda Python for your platform, which will automatically install all of the required software:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>https://www.anaconda.com/download/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please make sure to select the Python 3 version of the software. If you have an older version of Anaconda, we suggest uninstalling your current version and manually upgrading.</p>
<h3 id="download-and-run">Download and run</h3>
<p>The next step is to download the workshop materials and unzip them somewhere on your local machine. You can download the files here (note: the file is fairly large, at over 300Mb):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="dl-tutorial.zip" class="uri">dl-tutorial.zip</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, start the Anaconda navigator and launch a Jupyter notebook. Next, open the slides <code>distant-viewing-w-deep-learning.pdf</code> and start working your way through the material. Throughout the slides you will see references to the python notebooks, which should then be run from within Jupyter.</p>
