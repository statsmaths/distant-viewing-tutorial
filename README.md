# Distant Viewing with Deep Learning: An Introduction to Analyzing Large Corpora of Images

This repository contains materials related to the workshop that Lauren Tilton
and I gave at CMU and DH2018 - Mexico City. All of the materials for the
workshop are available here. The abstract for the workshop is as follows.

> This tutorial provides a hands-on introduction to the use of deep learning
> techniques in the study of large image corpora. The tensorflow and keras
> libraries within the Python programming language are used to facilitate this
> analysis. No prior programming experience is required.

> Image analysis tasks covered in the tutorial include object detection,
> facial recognition, image similarity, and image clustering. We will make
> three open-access image corpora (historic photographs, still frames from
> moving images, and scanned works of art) available in order to test these
> methods. Alternatively, participants may bring and use an image dataset of
> interest to them. At the conclusion of the tutorial, participants will have
> created an interactive website running locally on their machines. This
> website will provide tools for analyzing their selected dataset. Additional
> instructions for making the website publicly available will be provided.

Please let us know if you have any comments or questions. If you would be

### Fast-start

For a quick overview of the material covered in the workshop, you can view
the executed Python notebooks directly through GitHub with no required set-up.
Simply follow the links below (parts 3 and 5 are only applicable on your own
machine):

- [Part 1: Introduction and shallow features](https://github.com/statsmaths/distant-viewing-tutorial/blob/master/distant-viewing-tutorial-part-1.ipynb)
- [Part 2: Deep learning for image processing](https://github.com/statsmaths/distant-viewing-tutorial/blob/master/distant-viewing-tutorial-part-2.ipynb)
- [Part 4: Face detection and recognition](https://github.com/statsmaths/distant-viewing-tutorial/blob/master/distant-viewing-tutorial-part-4.ipynb)
- [Accompanying slides (pdf)](https://github.com/statsmaths/distant-viewing-tutorial/blob/master/distant-viewing-w-deep-learning.pdf)

We do, however, recommend following along with the materials and notes
on your own machine as described in the steps below.

### Set-up

To start, you'll need an up-to-date version of Python 3 and several common
modules. The easiest way to do this is to download and install Anaconda Python
for your platform, which will automatically install all of the required
software:

> https://www.anaconda.com/download/

Please make sure to select the Python 3 version of the software. If you have
an older version of Anaconda, we suggest uninstalling your current version and
manually upgrading.

### Download and run

The next step is to download the workshop materials and unzip them somewhere
on your local machine. You can download the files here (note: the file is
fairly large, at over 300Mb):

> [dl-tutorial.zip](dl-tutorial.zip)

Finally, start the Anaconda navigator and launch a Jupyter notebook. Next,
open the slides `distant-viewing-w-deep-learning.pdf` and start working your
way through the material. Throughout the slides you will see references to the
python notebooks, which should then be run from within Jupyter.
